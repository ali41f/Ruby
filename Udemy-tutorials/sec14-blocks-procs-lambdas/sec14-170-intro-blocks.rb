# block is a collection of code to be executed, rare exception in ruby
# blocks must be attache to a method call
# blocks alter the execution of the method
# a block is not an arg/param to the method
# blocks can be defined with "{ }" or "do end"
# block cn get or update the value of local var within the block

# Methods vs. blocks
# Methods can be invoked over and over, block only called once, then disappear
# a block isolates actions away from the method
