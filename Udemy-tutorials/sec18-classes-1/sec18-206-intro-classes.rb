# instance var (attr) are var that belong to the obj
# attr provide info about the obj's current state
# instance methods interact with the obj, they also belong to the obj
# encapsulation is a OOP concept that retricts direct access to an obj, only allow interactions in the secured ways defined

# classes and objs
# a class is the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for an obj
# an obj is an instance of the class, created from the class
# instantiation is the process of creating an obj from a class
# a class is calld an abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the data, much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process
