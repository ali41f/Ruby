think of a Ruby symbol as a sort of name. It's important to remember that symbols aren't strings:

"string" == :string # false
=end

puts "string".object_id
puts "string".object_id # always give different object_id

puts :symbol.object_id
puts :symbol.object_id # always give 788188

# The .object_id method gets the ID of an objectâ€”it's how Ruby knows whether two objects are the exact same object.
# Run the code in the editor to see that the two "strings" are actually different objects, whereas the :symbol is the same object listed twice.

:sasquatch.to_s

# The .to_s and .to_sym methods are what you're looking for!

strings1 = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]
symbols1 = []
strings1.each { |s| symbols1.push(s.intern) } # use .intern. This will internalize the string into a symbol and works just like .to_sym:
print symbols1, "\n"

Symbols make good hash keys for a few reasons:

They're immutable, meaning they can't be changed once they're created;
Only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory;
Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because of the above two reasons.
